# PiLet
PiLet is a project that connects a Raspberry Pi to an Android Application using the WiFi network. Connecting a relay to the Raspberry Pi
allows us to control an outlet. This will allow the user, on the Android Application, to turn something on and off with the click on the
Android Application.
